# Alias analysis

- How to do that?

# SCCP

- Implement it.

# LSRA

- Implement rest of the algorithm:

  * Finish unimplemented spilling functions.

  * Add register hint.

    Crucial, as xchg is very slow.

  * Fix PhiNode resolution pass.

    Currently we assume all the phi inputs are in the registers. This is
    not always true - for example, a vreg spilled before a loop and restored in
    the loop body might not be in the restored-to register at the loop end.

- Add rematerialization.

  * GCM hoist many constants to the first block and they occupy too many
    registers!

  * "Global code motion with spilling"?
