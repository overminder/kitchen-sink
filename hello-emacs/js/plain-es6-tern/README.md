### SYNOPSIS

A scratch project that shows how to use spacemacs's JavaScript layer for plain ES6.
We need to add some special configuration files:

- auto-completion (through `tern` - see `.tern-project` for its configurations.)
- syntax-checking (through `jshint` - see `.jshintrc` for its configurations.)
- formatting (through `js-beautify` - see `.jsbeautifyrc` for its configuraitons.)
